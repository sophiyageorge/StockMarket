Step 1: Import necessary libraries

install it using pip:


bash
pip install yfinance


Step 2: Download historical stock prices

The yfinance.download() function to download Tata Motors' historical stock prices. We'll specify the ticker symbol (TATAMOTORS.NS), the start date (2010-01-01), and the end date (2022-12-31).


import yfinance as yf

ticker_symbol = 'TATAMOTORS.NS'
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'

data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)


Step 3: Explore the data

First few rows of the data:


print(data.head())


We should see a table with the following columns:

| Column        | Description          |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Open           | Opening price         |
| High           | Highest price         |

| Adj Close      | Adjusted closing price |
| Volume         | Trading volume        |


 visualize the stock prices over time This will give us a better understanding of the overall trend and patterns in the data.

 create a line chart of the closing prices over time:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'])
plt.title('Tata Motors Closing Prices')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price (INR)')
plt.show()

 Some questions to consider:

- What is the overall trend in the stock prices?
- Are there any significant price movements or events?
- How does the stock price relate to economic indicators or other market trends?


Calculating Daily Returns

We can calculate the daily returns using the following formula:

Daily Return = (Closing Price - Previous Closing Price) / Previous Closing Price

data['Daily Return'] = data['Close'].pct_change()

pct_change() function to calculate the percentage change in the closing prices.

Visualizing Daily Returns

visualize the daily returns to get a better understanding of the volatility:

plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Daily Return'])
plt.title('Tata Motors Daily Returns')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Return (%)')
plt.show()

Analyzing Volatility

analyze the volatility of the stock.
use metrics such as standard deviation and variance to measure volatility

std_dev = data['Daily Return'].std()
variance = data['Daily Return'].var()

print(f'Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}%')
print(f'Variance: {variance:.2f}%')
